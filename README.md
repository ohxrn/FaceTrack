OpenCV: OpenCV, the Open Source Computer Vision Library, forms the backbone of our facial tracker. Its vast array of image processing functions and feature detection algorithms allow us to detect, track, and analyze facial landmarks with exceptional accuracy and speed.

Python: Our system is built entirely with Python, a versatile and high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Python's extensive libraries and ease of integration make it an ideal choice for rapid development and prototyping.

Mobile Integration: We specifically optimized our solution for mobile devices, enabling seamless integration with phone cameras. The lightweight nature of Python and OpenCV ensures smooth performance on resource-constrained devices.

Real-Time Processing: The core strength of our project lies in its real-time processing capabilities. By utilizing multi-threading and parallel processing techniques, we achieve low-latency tracking, allowing for instantaneous response and smooth tracking of facial movements.
